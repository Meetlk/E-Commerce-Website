# E-Commerce-Website

This project is a simple E-Commerce website built using the MERN stack. It enables users to sign up and log in, with user data stored in a MongoDB database. The user's password is protected (hashed) using Bcrypt, and JWT tokens are used for password verification during login. The frontend is created using CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript, and ReactJS.

## Key Features:
* **Frontend:** Built with Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS.
* **Backend:** Powered by Node.js and Express.js.
* **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data.
* **User Authentication:** Secure Sign-up and Login functionality.
* **Password Protection:** User passwords are hashed using Bcrypt.
